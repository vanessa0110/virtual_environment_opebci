We have interface.py which is the main program for the interface, with three files window0.py, window_1.py and window_2.py for the initial, first and second window.

Furthermore, to run this code you need to download the three images : openBCI (for the logo), banniere (for the first page) and head for the image of the window 1.
You need to change the direction like in the variable "link" and the "logo". 

Also you need to have the event.csv and data.csv
