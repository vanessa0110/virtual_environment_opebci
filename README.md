We have interface.py which is the main program for the interface, with two files window0.py, window_1.py for the initial and first window.
Bandpass.py and splite_task.py are used inside the other program so you need to download them also.

Furthermore, to run this code you need to download the four images : openBCI (for the logo), banniere (for the first page), head for the image of the window 1 and the loading image (for the loading window).
You need to change the direction like in the variable "link". The variable link is in interface.py at the beginning, in window0 at the beginning also and in window_1.py in the function window_1().

Also you need to have the event.csv and data.csv

GOOD LUCK !!!!!!!!!!!
